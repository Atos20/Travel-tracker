## Project Directions
[Travel-tracker specifications](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/travel-tracker.html)

## Context
Travel-tracker is the last solo project of mod 2 of Turing, School of Software and Design and it is a project that requires the use of dev dependencies, `API` request, and the use of array iterator methods to manipulate data. This applications also focuses on  creating and testing classes as well as the use of `chai-spies` to test on other methods and functions that are not part of the classes.

#### Technologies used:
  * JavaScript ES6
  * Terminal
  * GitHub
  * HTML
  * SCSS
  * moment.js
  * cha-spies

## Challenges

    - API's
    - Manipulation of nested data types
    - Use of chai-spies to spy on DOM related methods
    - Spies

## Wins

  * Use of chai-spies to test DOM related methods
  * Resolving API promises and responses
  * Project planning and organization
  * Array prototype methods
  * Practice OOP while creating the application
  * Using the project board * issues, labels and tickets* to keep track of my progress

## Future Goals

  * Better organiziation of `scss` file 
  * Spie on Dom relate methos
  * Run-through video of the project
  * Implement an animation using CSS and SASS
  * Add destinations
  * Remove trips and destinations
  * Add activities to each trip

## In Action

#### Take 1

- The agent needs tthe user-name `agency` and the password `travel2020`to log into the application.
- Once the applications has succesfully verified the agents credentials the agent can clearly see the following information being displayed on the agent's dashboard:

    - Today's Date
    - Earnings made over the current year
    - All pending trips
    - All today's trips

#### Take 2
- There are 50 travelers to choose from, when the traveler inputs  `traveler` followed by  any number between 01 and  50, it allows the travler to succesfully log into the account.
- The script verifies the travelers credentials and the travaler's dashboard displays the following; 

    - A `log-out` button
    - Welcoming message
    - Main `menu` button
    - `New Trip` button
    - `Destinations` button
    - `All trips` button
